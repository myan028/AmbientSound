# Ambient Sound

![Ambient Sound Logo](/AmbientSoundWPF/SplashScreen.png)

Ambient Sound is a simple, easy to use program that uses system input levels to instantaneously change output volume.
It simulates realtime noise cancellation by adapting your system volume to the external noise. 
This reduces distractions that may come from the ambient noise.
New features are being implemented regularly and current ones improved to make this program easier to use and more effective. 
This program is open source and open to suggestions, but not available for commercial use.
